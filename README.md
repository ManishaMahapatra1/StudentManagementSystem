# Welcome to Student Management System


A student information system (SIS), student management system, school administration software or student administration system is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data. Student information systems provide capabilities for registering students in courses; documenting grading, results of student tests and other assessment scores; building student schedules; tracking student attendance; and managing many other student-related data needs in a school.

Information security is a concern, as universities house an array of sensitive personal information, making them potentially attractive targets for security breaches, such as those experienced by retail corporations or healthcare providers.
